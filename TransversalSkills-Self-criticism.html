                During the process of completing the course tasks, we applied many Transversal Skills.

                <strong>1. Website Creation</strong>: We chose to use a webpage to showcase the skills we learned in the PPEI unit this semester because a website can organize the information we collected into neat and orderly entries. It also allows us to share information among group members and with others interested in our course. We started from scratch, learning about website coding, dividing tasks, and collaborating on different parts, eventually completing a full webpage.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-type1">
                <strong>2. Graphic Design</strong>: We mastered graphic design skills, using Adobe Photoshop to design our own business cards and creating invitations and event flow posters for the speed meeting.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-type1">
                <strong>3. Information Collection and Summarization</strong>: After identifying interview candidates, we conducted preliminary research on their work background and relevant company background. Specifically, we searched related company websites and made targeted modifications to our questionnaire based on specific fields and professions to ensure we obtained the most desired and professional knowledge. After the interviews, we organized the interview drafts, completed the professional database, and summarized the interviews.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-type1">
                <strong>4. Team Collaboration</strong>: At the beginning of the course, we divided tasks for writing the questionnaire, inviting professionals, and designing the final presentation while brainstorming unique formats for our group. We decided to present our PPEI course results in the form of a website. During the interviews, we took on roles as questioners, recorders, and timekeepers, successfully completing four interviews.

                Constructive self-criticism of what could/should have been done:

            <p class="paragraph-type1">
                1. Time Management: Undoubtedly, this interview process took a lot of time. Our group conducted four off-online interviews in two weeks, which greatly stressed our studies. This may have been due to insufficient time allocated for the interview phase in our initial project planning, difficulties in coordinating with professionals, and an already packed course schedule, squeezing the interviews into a short period. There was a gap between planning and execution, so we should flexibly improve scheduling in future projects.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-type1">
                2. Participation and Initiative: Looking back at the course, we realized there is room to improve our participation in class discussions. We should be more proactive in asking questions, responding to others’ views, and engaging with other groups to enhance our sense of involvement and a deeper understanding of the course content.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-type1">
                3. Communication Skills: There were times when disagreements or unclear expressions during team collaboration slowed project progress. To address this, we need to improve our communication skills, particularly in giving constructive feedback and being open and cooperative when accepting others' opinions.
